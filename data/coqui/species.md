# Coqui Species of Puerto Rico

## Overview

Puerto Rico is home to 17 species of Eleutherodactylus frogs, commonly known as Coquis. Each species has unique characteristics that can inform game design and educational content.

## Primary Species

### 1. Common Coqui (Eleutherodactylus coqui)
**Game-Relevant Characteristics:**
- **Size**: 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm)
- **Color**: Variable - brown, gray, green, or yellow with darker markings
- **Call**: Distinctive "co-kee" (hence the name)
- **Habitat**: Ubiquitous - forests, gardens, urban areas
- **Behavior**: Nocturnal, territorial, excellent climbers
- **Seasonality**: Year-round, peak breeding in spring/summer

**Game Mechanics Ideas:**
- Main character species
- Different color variations as unlockables
- Territorial behavior for level design
- Climbing abilities for platformer mechanics

### 2. Forest Coqui (Eleutherodactylus portoricensis)
**Game-Relevant Characteristics:**
- **Size**: 1.5-2.5 inches (3.8-6.4 cm)
- **Color**: Brown with darker stripes or spots
- **Call**: Lower-pitched than common coqui
- **Habitat**: Dense forest understory
- **Behavior**: More secretive, ground-dwelling
- **Seasonality**: Rainy season activity

**Game Mechanics Ideas:**
- Stealth mechanics
- Forest-specific levels
- Different movement patterns

### 3. Whistling Coqui (Eleutherodactylus cochranae)
**Game-Relevant Characteristics:**
- **Size**: 0.8-1.2 inches (2-3 cm)
- **Color**: Bright green with yellow markings
- **Call**: High-pitched whistle
- **Habitat**: High elevation forests
- **Behavior**: Arboreal, rarely descends to ground
- **Seasonality**: Cooler months activity

**Game Mechanics Ideas:**
- High-altitude levels
- Whistle-based communication mechanics
- Bright colors for visibility

## Visual Characteristics for Game Design

### Color Variations
- **Common Coqui**: Brown, gray, green, yellow
- **Patterns**: Stripes, spots, solid colors
- **Seasonal Changes**: Some species change color with temperature
- **Gender Differences**: Males often more colorful during breeding

### Size Variations
- **Smallest**: 0.8 inches (Whistling Coqui)
- **Largest**: 2.5 inches (Forest Coqui)
- **Average**: 1.5 inches

### Physical Features
- **Toe Pads**: Large, sticky for climbing
- **Eyes**: Large, bulging for nocturnal vision
- **Skin**: Smooth, moist
- **Legs**: Long, powerful for jumping

## Behavioral Patterns for Game Mechanics

### Daily Activity
- **Nocturnal**: Active at night
- **Crepuscular**: Peak activity at dawn/dusk
- **Resting**: Daytime hiding in vegetation

### Seasonal Behavior
- **Breeding Season**: Spring/Summer (increased vocalization)
- **Rainy Season**: More active, expanded territories
- **Dry Season**: Reduced activity, concentrated in wet areas

### Territorial Behavior
- **Male Territories**: 10-50 square meters
- **Vocal Defense**: Calling to establish boundaries
- **Physical Defense**: Rare, mostly vocal

## Conservation Status

### Threatened Species
- **Golden Coqui** (E. jasperi): Critically endangered
- **Mona Coqui** (E. monensis): Endangered
- **Web-footed Coqui** (E. karlschmidti): Endangered

### Conservation Challenges
- Habitat loss from development
- Climate change affecting breeding patterns
- Invasive species competition
- Disease (chytrid fungus)

## Game Design Applications

### Character Classes
1. **Common Coqui**: Balanced, all-around abilities
2. **Forest Coqui**: Stealth and ground movement
3. **Whistling Coqui**: High mobility and communication

### Level Themes
- **Rainforest**: Dense vegetation, multiple species
- **Urban**: Adaptation to human environments
- **High Elevation**: Cooler, different vegetation
- **Coastal**: Mangrove and beach ecosystems

### Audio Design
- **Species-Specific Calls**: Different sounds for different characters
- **Environmental Audio**: Rain, wind, other animals
- **Communication Mechanics**: Using calls to solve puzzles

### Educational Elements
- **Species Identification**: Learning to recognize different coquis
- **Habitat Requirements**: Understanding ecosystem needs
- **Conservation Messages**: Highlighting threats and solutions
