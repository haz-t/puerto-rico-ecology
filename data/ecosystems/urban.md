- **Microclimates:** Urban heat islands, altered rainfall patterns

## Ecological Importance
- **Biodiversity Refuges:** Urban gardens and parks can support native plants and pollinators
- **Ecosystem Services:** Air purification, temperature regulation, recreation

## Conservation
- Threats: Habitat fragmentation, pollution, invasive species
