# Puerto Rican Ecology & Coqui Research

A comprehensive knowledge base for Puerto Rican biodiversity, ecosystems, and the iconic Coqui frog. This repository serves as a research foundation for educational games and conservation awareness projects.

## 🐸 Coqui (Eleutherodactylus spp.)

The Coqui is Puerto Rico's national symbol and most recognizable amphibian. These small tree frogs are endemic to Puerto Rico and play crucial roles in the island's ecosystems.

### Key Game-Relevant Features:
- **Vocalizations**: Distinct "co-kee" call (hence the name)
- **Habitat Diversity**: From rainforests to urban areas
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Nocturnal, territorial, seasonal breeding
- **Visual Characteristics**: Various colors and patterns by species
- **Ecological Role**: Insect control, indicator species
