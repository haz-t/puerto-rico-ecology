# Game Assets

This folder is for storing or referencing game-ready assets (images, audio, sprites) for use in Coqui and Puerto Rican ecology games.

- Add your PNGs, SVGs, or sound files here.
- Organize by type (e.g., /images, /sounds, /sprites).
- See `assets/` for raw ecological reference material.
